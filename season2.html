    <p>This is the official trailer for Season 2 of La Casa de Papel. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2 id="h2s1">Who has died so far?</h2>
    <p>Now that the heist is over let's recap on who actually died.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Oslo is the first one of the gang to die. He dies in the end of Season 1.</li>
        <li>The second heist member to die is Moscow. Moscow gets shot whilst protecting
            <br>Tokyo as she enters the Mint on a dirtbike.
        </li>
        <li>The worst death I think is when Berlin sacrifices himself for the others
            <br>so that they can get those extra few second and escape without being caught.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: black;">&#128532; R.I.P OSLO, MOSCOW AND BERLIN &#128532;</h3>

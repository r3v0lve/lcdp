    <p>Season four had started with the gang trying to save Nairobi who had been shot, 
        <br>as she had been lured to a window. They thought about sending Nairobi out of the Bank
        <br>so that she could get the care she needed. But it was too dangerous so they took the bullet out
        <br>themselves! As she seemed to recover well she encouraged the gang to continue with the heist. 
        <br>But she ended up facing the barrel of a gun once more as one of the hostages Gandia had escaped 
        <br>and had been spying on them. He managed to track Nairobi down and ended up shooting her in the head, 
        <br>killing her instantly! It was a very sad ending. Still not over it.

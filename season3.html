    <p>Here is the new team from front to back:</p>
    <p>In the front we have <strong>the Professor</strong> who is the brain of this heist.
        <br>Standing next to him we have well known <strong>Tokyo</strong>. Tokyos boyfriend, <strong>Rio</strong>,
        <br>is beside her. Then we have <strong>Nairobi</strong> looking very angry. <strong>Denver</strong>, who 
        <br>is now a father is beside Nairobi. The mother of Denvers son is <strong>Stockholm</strong>.
        <br>In the previous Seasons she was known as Monica Gaztambide. We have another 
        <br>member. It is <strong>Lisbon</strong>. Yes, she is now called Lisbon. Lisbon was known as 
        <br>the inspector leading the case in the last two Seasons. Now we have a another
        <br>familiar face. It's <strong>Helsinki</strong> with a lolipop!! The new leader, <strong>Palermo</strong>, is 
        <br>standing beside Helsinki. Next to Palermo is <strong>Marseille</strong>. He will actually not be 
        <br>inside the building during the heist. Go watch Money Heist to see what happens!
        <br>Last but not least we <strong>Bogota</strong>. He is like a replacment of Moscow.
